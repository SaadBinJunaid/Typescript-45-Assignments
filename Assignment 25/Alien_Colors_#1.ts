//Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

//Create a variable called alien_color:

let AlienColors :string ="green";

//Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

if(AlienColors === "green"){
    console.log( "the player just earned 5 points !."); 
}

//Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
